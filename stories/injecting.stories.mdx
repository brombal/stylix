# Stylix Demos

These demos are to develop and test functionality. They aren't meant to be exhaustive tests or be
full demonstrations. They are just a useful way to playground features.

## Injecting styles

If you don't want to create a new DOM element, you can use the `$inject` prop to pass style props
down to each child element, which will override the style props on them.

  <Story name="Injecting styles">
    <>
      <$ $inject color="blue" background="lightgreen">
        <$ border="1px solid red" background="blue">
          blue text (injected) / green bg (injected, overridden) / green border
        </$>
      </$>
      <$ $inject color="blue" background="lightgreen">
        <div>blue text (injected) / green bg (injected, overridden)</div>
      </$>
    </>
