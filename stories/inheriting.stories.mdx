# Stylix Demos

These demos are to develop and test functionality. They aren't meant to be exhaustive tests or be
full demonstrations. They are just a useful way to playground features.

## Inheriting styles

Just like with regular css, deeper element styles will naturally override styles from the parent
elements.

This is in contrast with `$inject`ing styles, which overrides the children's styles with the
parent's (see below).

<Preview>
  <Story name="Inherited style">
    <>
      <$ color="green">
        <div>green text</div>
        <$ color="blue">blue text (override)</$>
        <div>green text</div>
      </$>
    </>
  </Story>
</Preview>
